# This one's for the assembler. 


Firstly, let's figure out the entire specification, using that above chart and the book chapter as references. Then we will do an implementation. 

Tutorials use CPP. But to prevent myself from blindly copying everything, i will use Python due to it's easier syntax.

## Specification

refer to the above charts for guidance. Not my chart, got it off youtube from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZ10SOChdPo&list=PLT4mIxZjQO1rTavJ5zelv_gr0rR7lkAwm&index=8&pp=iAQB)

This clearly summarizes the entire specification as mentioned in the book. I suppose realizing this was a big part of this assignment, but even if i tried to, i'm just too lazy to make such a comprehensive chart. 

I did go through the chapter and verify that it's accurate. 

## Implementation
Each of the following subheadings will be it's own python file defining a class

### Symbol Table

### Parser

### Code module

### Assembler


## Future improvements

Error checking, reporting, and handling

File management
