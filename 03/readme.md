# This project is to make memory elements along with a program counter

To do: 
1. Understand what's the difference between the two alternative ways of writing the PC and why both work.
2. A lot of the material covered in this uptil now, is also the part of Electronics and COA courses I took in college, But i've mostly forgotten those stuff within weeks after the exams. What can I learn from my notes from those topics to more flesh out the things I implemented here?
